// The reason we use headers is to split up all the programming, so it's not all running in one folder,
// some benifits of this is glitch control. If a glitch happens in one peice of the code (but it's split up)
// it won't affect other codes in other folders

int num = 10; // this is an integer. an integer allows you to store values in a name.
// in this case the value is 10, and the name is num.
